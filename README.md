Rizkamons Brain/Rot edition (aka Monsters of Dawn) is a Pokemon-insipred game.

This game is still in active development.
In the future, I would like to enhance and add more complex battle mechanics as well as a storyline.

# How to play

Visit the region of brainrot where you can meet interesting people and places! Talk to NPCs, visit buildings and battle gym leaders!
However, beware, as walking on tall grass is dangerous: Rizkamons may hop out the grass and attack you! There is a large variety of Rizkamons (8 as I'm writing this) who have a chance of appearing if you walk on tall grass.

The game ends once you complete your Rizkadex and catch all Rizkamons.

# What to explore

Explore unique cities such as Rizz city and Gyatt city as well as small towns such as Rizzalations town or even countless other places such as Skibidi forest and Edger's mountain!

# Why should I play this game?

Rizkamons Brain/Rot edition is a captivating memorable experience due to its funny and simplistic aspects.
Overall, JUST PLAY THIS GAME TO HAVE FUN!
And while at it, why not give me some Feedback? ;)
